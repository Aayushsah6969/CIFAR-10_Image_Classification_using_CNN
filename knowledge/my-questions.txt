i got this visualization:
will the ML work properly on  this blur images?? since i which i dowloaded was blur too 

Yes. This is correct. Nothing is wrong.
These are not blurred because of download issue.
CIFAR-10 images are:
32 × 32 pixels
Very low resolution
Naturally look pixelated / blurry when enlarged
You are visualizing tiny images on a larger canvas — that’s why they look blurry.
Important Understanding
CNN does not see blur the way humans do.
It sees:
Pixel intensity patterns
Edges
Color gradients
Local spatial structures
Even at 32×32, there is enough information for classification.





Important rule in ML:

Always build a simple working baseline first.
Then improve systematically.

If you start adding everything now, you won’t know what actually helped.
